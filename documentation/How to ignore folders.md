# How to ignore folders
It's possible to prevent the content of some folders to be displayed in Gallery+

## Steps to follow
1. Switch to the "Files" app
2. Navigate to the folder you want to hide
3. Click on the "New" button sitting above the list of files
4. Type ".nomedia" as the filename

You're done. The folder will be ignored in Gallery+ from now on.

You can also create that file in your mobile or desktop OS and sync it with your ownCloud.

## Tips
On Windows, it's not straight forward to create filenames which start with a dot.
The trick is to create ".nomedia." file with two dots. Windows will remove the trailing one.
